        <h1>Video games</h1>
        <p>I personally really enjoy playing video games within my pasttime. It's something that a lot of people across the world 
            have in common. All throughout the world there are all sorts of people who play video games. These video games have
            all sorts of different genres that can match how any person would want to play.
        </p>
        <p>There are plenty of types of video games that a lot of people like to play that are very different from eachother.
            There are some games that are multiplayer where you can either compete with other people around the world or you can 
            play with other people. With multiplayer games there are all sorts of different game types like a very popular format
            called hero shooters. With hero shooters you can select a character who has special abilities unique to them and you
            can use this character to compete with others.
